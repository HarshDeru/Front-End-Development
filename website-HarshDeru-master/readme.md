# CTEC3905 ASSIGNMENT

Welcome. This is your assignment repository.

In this file, we will expect a brief description of your project in [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) format.
Try to keep it to a maximum of about 300 words.
Though shorter is no problem.

The description should include a summary of your site content and the primary audience you are targeting.
Also include a brief description of how you have organised the content (a few sentences is fine) for the audience.
Make some specific reference to how you have adapted your site for different screen sizes.

If there are any parts of your code or user interface that need further explanation, you can include that here.
If anything is broken or doesn't quite work properly, you may explain what it SHOULD do.

You **must** include references (including links) to any external resources/videos/code examples that you have used here.

## Things to do

- Replace the content inside [index.html](index.html) with your own structured HTML.
- Replace the [replaceme.css](replaceme.css) and [replaceme.js](js/replaceme.js) files with your own files.
- Update the `<link>` and `<script>` elements to point to your new files.
- Replace the contents of this file (readme.md) with your own short project description as detailed above.

>We don't expect there to be much left of the original content in these files once you are done.
It should be all your own code.

## DESCRIPTION about the website
######

## Summary
As a front-end developer, my main goal is to create an impressive portfolio website that is not only responsive but also user-friendly and easy to navigate. My portfolio website consists of various sections, including a home page, experience page, about me page, and contact page.

The home page offers basic information about myself, while the experience page showcases my skills and experience in a visually appealing manner. The about me page provides visitors with a detailed timeline of my background, education, and achievements, which helps potential clients or employers get to know me better. Furthermore, the contact page includes a form that visitors can fill out to get in touch with me easily.

In order to provide the best user experience, my portfolio website is designed to be responsive to different screen sizes. This means that the layout adjusts automatically depending on the device being used, be it a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. This ensures that visitors can view and navigate the website without any difficulty, regardless of the device they are using.

Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in front-end web development, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have utilized my skills and creativity to develop a website that effectively showcases my abilities and serves as a platform to attract potential clients or employers. By creating this portfolio website, I am confident that I can demonstrate my skills and contribute to the success of future projects.
